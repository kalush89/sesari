# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This spec defines Row-Level Security (RLS) implementation to ensure complete data isolation between workspaces in Sesari's multi-tenant architecture. All database access must be workspace-scoped to prevent cross-tenant data leaks.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all database queries to be automatically scoped to the current workspace, so that users can never access data from other workspaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user makes any database query THEN the system SHALL automatically inject workspace_id context
2. WHEN RLS policies are enabled THEN users SHALL only see data belonging to their current workspace
3. IF a query attempts cross-workspace access THEN the system SHALL block the query and log the violation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want RLS context to be automatically managed, so that I don't need to manually add workspace filtering to every query.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using Prisma client THEN workspace context SHALL be automatically injected via middleware
2. WHEN switching workspaces THEN the RLS context SHALL be updated immediately
3. WHEN no workspace context exists THEN database queries SHALL be blocked

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a security auditor, I want all cross-tenant access attempts to be logged, so that security violations can be detected and investigated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN RLS blocks a query THEN the system SHALL log the violation with user and workspace details
2. WHEN audit logs are generated THEN they SHALL include timestamp, user_id, attempted workspace_id, and query type
3. WHEN violations occur THEN alerts SHALL be sent to security monitoring systems
