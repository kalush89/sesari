# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This system integrates with Lemon Squeezy for payment processing and includes webhook handling for real-time subscription updates.

## Requirements

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks upgrade to starter plan THEN the system SHALL offer 14-day free trial
2. WHEN trial is activated THEN the system SHALL enable starter plan features immediately
3. WHEN trial expires THEN the system SHALL automatically start billing or downgrade to free
4. IF user has active subscription THEN the system SHALL display current plan status and trial information in dashboard
5. WHEN user accesses premium features THEN the system SHALL verify plan eligibility including trial status

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user with a paid subscription or trial, I want to manage my billing details and view my subscription status, so that I can control my account and payments.

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to enforce plan-based feature limits, so that users only access features they've paid for.

1. WHEN free user attempts to add integrations THEN the system SHALL block action and show upgrade prompt
2. WHEN free user exceeds workspace limits THEN the system SHALL prevent creation of additional workspaces
3. IF user downgrades plan THEN the system SHALL disable premium features but preserve data

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want reliable webhook processing, so that subscription changes are immediately reflected in the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Lemon Squeezy sends webhook THEN the system SHALL verify signature and process event
2. IF webhook processing fails THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff
3. WHEN subscription status changes THEN the system SHALL update database and invalidate user sessions
4. IF duplicate webhooks arrive THEN the system SHALL handle idempotently without errors
