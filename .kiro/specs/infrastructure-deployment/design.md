# Infrastructure & Deployment Design

## Overview

The infrastructure design follows a multi-environment approach with infrastructure as code, automated CI/CD, and secure secret management. The architecture separates frontend deployment (Vercel) from backend services (Fly.io/AWS) for optimal performance and cost efficiency.

## Architecture

### Environment Structure
```
Production Environment
├── Frontend (Vercel)
├── Backend API (Fly.io/AWS)
├── Database (PostgreSQL with RLS)
├── Worker Services (Background jobs)
└── Secret Manager (AWS/Cloud provider)

Staging Environment
├── Frontend (Vercel Preview)
├── Backend API (Fly.io/AWS staging)
├── Database (Staging PostgreSQL)
└── Worker Services (Staging)

Development Environment
├── Local development
├── Docker compose for services
└── Local PostgreSQL
```

### Deployment Targets
- **Frontend**: Vercel for Next.js app with automatic CDN and edge optimization
- **Backend**: Supabase
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with connection pooling
- **Secrets**: AWS Secret Manager for production, environment variables for development

## Components and Interfaces

### Infrastructure as Code (`/infra`)
```
/infra/
├── terraform/
│   ├── environments/
│   │   ├── dev/
│   │   ├── staging/
│   │   └── prod/
│   ├── modules/
│   │   ├── database/
│   │   ├── secrets/
│   │   └── compute/
│   └── shared/
└── scripts/
    ├── deploy.sh
    └── validate.sh
```

### CI/CD Pipeline (`.github/workflows`)
```
/workflows/
├── ci.yml (lint, test, security scan)
├── deploy-staging.yml (auto-deploy on main)
├── deploy-prod.yml (manual approval)
└── infra-validate.yml (terraform plan)
```

### Secret Management
- **Development**: `.env.local` files (gitignored)
- **Staging/Production**: AWS Secret Manager with IAM roles
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Secrets for deployment credentials

## Data Models

### Environment Configuration
```typescript
interface EnvironmentConfig {
  name: 'dev' | 'staging' | 'prod'
  database: {
    host: string
    port: number
    ssl: boolean
  }
  secrets: {
    provider: 'aws' | 'local'
    region?: string
  }
  deployment: {
    frontend: 'vercel'
    backend: 'fly' | 'aws'
  }
}
```

### Deployment Manifest
```typescript
interface DeploymentManifest {
  version: string
  environment: string
  services: {
    frontend: { url: string; commit: string }
    api: { url: string; commit: string }
    worker: { status: string; commit: string }
  }
  infrastructure: {
    terraform_version: string
    last_applied: string
  }
}
```

## Error Handling

### Infrastructure Failures
- Terraform state backup and recovery procedures
- Rollback mechanisms for failed deployments
- Health checks and monitoring for all services
- Automated alerts for infrastructure issues

### Deployment Failures
- Automatic rollback on failed health checks
- Staging environment validation before production
- Database migration rollback procedures
- Service dependency validation

### Secret Management Failures
- Fallback mechanisms for secret retrieval
- Rotation procedures for compromised secrets
- Audit logging for secret access
- Emergency access procedures

## Testing Strategy

### Infrastructure Testing
- Terraform validation and linting in CI
- Infrastructure dry-run testing
- Security scanning of Terraform configurations
- Cost estimation for infrastructure changes

### Deployment Testing
- Automated smoke tests after deployment
- Health check validation
- Database migration testing
- Integration testing across environments

### Security Testing
- Secret scanning in CI/CD
- Infrastructure security compliance checks
- Access control validation
- Vulnerability scanning of deployed services

### Monitoring and Observability
- Application performance monitoring
- Infrastructure metrics and alerting
- Log aggregation and analysis
- Uptime monitoring for all services
