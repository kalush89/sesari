# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This spec defines the infrastructure and deployment requirements for Sesari, ensuring reliable, secure, and scalable deployment of all services with proper CI/CD automation and environment isolation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want infrastructure as code using Terraform, so that I can manage and version control all cloud resources consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN infrastructure changes are needed THEN the system SHALL use Terraform configurations to provision resources
2. WHEN deploying to any environment THEN the system SHALL apply infrastructure changes through code rather than manual configuration
3. WHEN reviewing infrastructure changes THEN the system SHALL provide clear diff outputs showing what will be modified

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want all secrets managed through cloud secret manager, so that sensitive data is never stored in the repository.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application needs secrets THEN the system SHALL retrieve them from AWS Secret Manager or equivalent
2. WHEN deploying code THEN the system SHALL NOT contain any hardcoded API keys, database passwords, or other sensitive data
3. WHEN accessing secrets THEN the system SHALL use proper IAM roles and permissions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated CI/CD pipeline with quality gates, so that code changes are validated before deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to main branch THEN the system SHALL run linting, testing, and security scans
2. WHEN all checks pass THEN the system SHALL automatically deploy to staging environment
3. WHEN deploying to production THEN the system SHALL require manual approval after staging validation
4. WHEN any check fails THEN the system SHALL prevent deployment and notify the team

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want isolated environments for development, staging, and production, so that I can test changes safely without affecting live users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to different environments THEN the system SHALL maintain separate databases and resources
2. WHEN testing new features THEN the system SHALL allow deployment to staging without affecting production
3. WHEN environment-specific configuration is needed THEN the system SHALL use environment variables or separate config files

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want optimized deployment targets for different service types, so that costs are minimized while maintaining performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the Next.js frontend THEN the system SHALL use Vercel for optimal performance and CDN distribution
2. WHEN deploying backend services THEN the system SHALL use Supabase or AWS for scalable compute resources
3. WHEN deploying worker processes THEN the system SHALL use appropriate container orchestration for background jobs
