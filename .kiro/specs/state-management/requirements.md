# State Management Requirements

## Introduction

The state management system coordinates UI reactivity, data synchronization, and workspace context across the Sesari Next.js application. It ensures predictable state flow compatible with React Server Components while maintaining optimal performance for KPI dashboards and goal tracking.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clear separation between server and client state, so that I can optimize performance and maintain data consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL use React Query for all server-side data (KPIs, goals, integrations)
2. WHEN UI interactions occur THEN the system SHALL use Zustand for client-side state (modals, filters, workspace context)
3. WHEN form submissions happen THEN the system SHALL use React Hook Form for input validation and state management

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want my workspace context to persist across page navigation, so that I don't lose my current workspace selection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a workspace THEN the system SHALL store the workspace ID in Zustand state
2. WHEN the user navigates between pages THEN the system SHALL maintain the active workspace context
3. WHEN the user refreshes the page THEN the system SHALL restore the workspace context from session storage

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want optimistic updates for goal progress, so that the interface feels responsive during interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user updates goal progress THEN the system SHALL immediately update the UI state
2. WHEN the server request completes THEN the system SHALL sync the optimistic update with server response
3. WHEN the server request fails THEN the system SHALL revert the optimistic update and show an error

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want my UI preferences to persist, so that my dashboard layout and theme choices are remembered.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user toggles the sidebar THEN the system SHALL store the collapsed state in Zustand
2. WHEN a user changes theme preference THEN the system SHALL persist the choice in localStorage
3. WHEN a user applies dashboard filters THEN the system SHALL maintain filter state during the session

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want integration connection states to be reactive, so that users see real-time sync status and errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an integration sync starts THEN the system SHALL update the connection state to "syncing"
2. WHEN an integration sync completes THEN the system SHALL update the last sync timestamp
3. WHEN an integration fails THEN the system SHALL store the error state and display reconnection prompts
