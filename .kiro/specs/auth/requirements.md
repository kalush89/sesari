# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The authentication system is the foundation of Sesari's multi-tenant SaaS platform. It provides secure user authentication via Google OAuth, workspace-based authorization, role-based access control, and enforces Row-Level Security (RLS) for data isolation. This system ensures that users can only access data within their authorized workspaces while maintaining security best practices for a B2B SaaS application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a founder, I want to sign in with my Google account, so that I can quickly access Sesari without creating another password.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the sign-in page THEN the system SHALL display a "Sign in with Google" button
2. WHEN a user clicks "Sign in with Google" THEN the system SHALL redirect to Google OAuth consent screen
3. WHEN a user completes Google OAuth THEN the system SHALL create or update their user profile with Google account information
4. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to their dashboard
5. IF Google OAuth fails THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message and allow retry

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a workspace owner, I want to invite team members to my workspace, so that we can collaborate on KPI tracking and objectives.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a workspace owner sends an invitation THEN the system SHALL create a pending workspace membership record
2. WHEN an invited user signs in for the first time THEN the system SHALL automatically add them to the workspace with the invited role
3. WHEN a user is added to a workspace THEN the system SHALL enforce their role permissions immediately
4. IF an invitation expires THEN the system SHALL prevent automatic workspace access and require a new invitation
5. WHEN a user has multiple workspace memberships THEN the system SHALL allow them to switch between workspaces

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want role-based access control within workspaces, so that I can manage what team members can do with KPIs and objectives.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is assigned the "owner" role THEN the system SHALL grant full workspace management permissions
2. WHEN a user is assigned the "admin" role THEN the system SHALL grant KPI and objective management permissions but not billing access
3. WHEN a user is assigned the "member" role THEN the system SHALL grant read-only access to KPIs and objectives
4. WHEN a user attempts an unauthorized action THEN the system SHALL deny access and return a 403 error
5. IF a user's role changes THEN the system SHALL immediately update their permissions without requiring re-authentication

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security-conscious founder, I want all data to be isolated by workspace, so that my company's KPIs cannot be accessed by users from other workspaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any database query is executed THEN the system SHALL automatically enforce workspace-based Row-Level Security
2. WHEN a user accesses KPI data THEN the system SHALL only return data from their current workspace context
3. WHEN API endpoints are called THEN the system SHALL validate workspace access before processing any data operations
4. IF a user attempts to access data from an unauthorized workspace THEN the system SHALL deny access and log the attempt
5. WHEN RLS policies are applied THEN the system SHALL ensure no data leakage between workspaces under any circumstances

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want session management and middleware protection, so that all protected routes are automatically secured without manual checks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses a protected route THEN the system SHALL verify their authentication status via middleware
2. WHEN a session expires THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to the sign-in page
3. WHEN a user signs out THEN the system SHALL invalidate their session and clear all authentication tokens
4. IF an unauthenticated user tries to access protected content THEN the system SHALL redirect them to sign-in
5. WHEN session validation occurs THEN the system SHALL also verify workspace access permissions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want my workspace context to persist across browser sessions, so that I don't have to reselect my workspace every time I return to the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a workspace THEN the system SHALL store the workspace context in their session
2. WHEN a user returns to the application THEN the system SHALL automatically load their last selected workspace
3. WHEN a user switches workspaces THEN the system SHALL update their session context immediately
4. IF a user no longer has access to their previously selected workspace THEN the system SHALL default to their first available workspace
5. WHEN workspace context changes THEN the system SHALL update all UI components to reflect the new workspace data

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want proper error handling and loading states during authentication, so that I understand what's happening and can recover from issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication is in progress THEN the system SHALL display appropriate loading indicators
2. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display specific, actionable error messages
3. WHEN network issues occur during sign-in THEN the system SHALL provide retry options
4. IF Google OAuth is temporarily unavailable THEN the system SHALL inform users and suggest trying again later
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log technical details for debugging while showing user-friendly messages
