# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The billing system manages subscription plans through Lemon Squeezy integration, enforcing feature limits and workspace restrictions based on user plan tiers. It handles Free, Starter, and Pro plans with trial periods, usage tracking, and webhook processing for real-time subscription updates.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to start with a free plan that has basic features, so that I can evaluate the platform before upgrading.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user signs up THEN the system SHALL assign them to the Free plan by default
2. WHEN a user is on the Free plan THEN the system SHALL limit them to 1 workspace maximum
3. WHEN a user is on the Free plan THEN the system SHALL limit them to 5 KPIs per workspace
4. WHEN a user is on the Free plan THEN the system SHALL restrict access to integrations (Stripe and manual KPIs only)
5. WHEN a user is on the Free plan THEN the system SHALL restrict access to AI features

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user ready to upgrade, I want to subscribe to a paid plan through Lemon Squeezy, so that I can access premium features and increased limits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks upgrade THEN the system SHALL redirect them to Lemon Squeezy checkout
2. WHEN a user completes payment THEN the system SHALL receive a webhook notification
3. WHEN a webhook confirms subscription THEN the system SHALL update the user's plan in the database
4. WHEN a user subscribes to Starter plan THEN the system SHALL allow up to 3 workspaces
5. WHEN a user subscribes to Starter plan THEN the system SHALL allow up to 15 KPIs per workspace
6. WHEN a user subscribes to Pro plan THEN the system SHALL allow unlimited workspaces
7. WHEN a user subscribes to Pro plan THEN the system SHALL allow unlimited KPIs per workspace
8. WHEN a user subscribes to any paid plan THEN the system SHALL enable all integrations
9. WHEN a user subscribes to any paid plan THEN the system SHALL enable AI features

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a potential customer, I want to try premium features with a 14-day trial, so that I can evaluate the full platform before committing to payment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user starts a trial THEN the system SHALL grant Pro plan features for 14 days
2. WHEN a user is in trial period THEN the system SHALL display remaining trial days
3. WHEN trial expires AND no subscription exists THEN the system SHALL downgrade to Free plan
4. WHEN trial expires THEN the system SHALL send email notifications at 7 days, 3 days, and 1 day remaining
5. WHEN trial expires THEN the system SHALL restrict access to trial-only features immediately
6. WHEN a user subscribes during trial THEN the system SHALL convert trial to paid subscription

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want real-time subscription updates through webhooks, so that user access is immediately updated when payments succeed or fail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Lemon Squeezy sends a subscription webhook THEN the system SHALL verify the webhook signature
2. WHEN a subscription is created THEN the system SHALL update user plan and limits
3. WHEN a subscription is cancelled THEN the system SHALL schedule downgrade at period end
4. WHEN a subscription payment fails THEN the system SHALL send notification and maintain access for grace period
5. WHEN a subscription is renewed THEN the system SHALL extend access period
6. WHEN webhook processing fails THEN the system SHALL log error and retry with exponential backoff

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user with an active subscription, I want to manage my billing details and view usage, so that I can monitor my account and make informed decisions about my plan.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses billing settings THEN the system SHALL display current plan and usage statistics
2. WHEN a user views billing THEN the system SHALL show workspace count vs limit
3. WHEN a user views billing THEN the system SHALL show KPI count vs limit per workspace
4. WHEN a user approaches limits THEN the system SHALL display warning messages
5. WHEN a user exceeds limits THEN the system SHALL prevent creation of new resources
6. WHEN a user wants to change plan THEN the system SHALL redirect to Lemon Squeezy customer portal

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user approaching plan limits, I want clear notifications and upgrade prompts, so that I can seamlessly upgrade when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user reaches 80% of workspace limit THEN the system SHALL display upgrade notification
2. WHEN a user reaches 80% of KPI limit THEN the system SHALL display upgrade notification in affected workspace
3. WHEN a user tries to exceed limits THEN the system SHALL show modal with upgrade options
4. WHEN a user tries to access restricted features THEN the system SHALL show feature upgrade prompt
5. WHEN upgrade prompts are shown THEN the system SHALL include direct links to Lemon Squeezy checkout

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling for billing operations, so that users receive clear feedback and the system remains stable during payment issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Lemon Squeezy is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display maintenance message and preserve current access
2. WHEN webhook signature verification fails THEN the system SHALL log security event and reject request
3. WHEN subscription lookup fails THEN the system SHALL use cached plan data and retry lookup
4. WHEN plan limits cannot be enforced THEN the system SHALL log error and default to most restrictive limits
5. WHEN billing API calls timeout THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff retry logic
