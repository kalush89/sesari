# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature provides multi-workspace support for Sesari, allowing users to manage different teams, products, or business units in separate workspaces. Each workspace will have its own KPIs, goals, and strategies with proper access control and data isolation using Row-Level Security (RLS).

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a founder, I want to create and manage multiple workspaces, so that I can separate different business units or products.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a new workspace THEN the system SHALL create a workspace with a unique identifier and the user as the owner
2. WHEN a user views their workspaces THEN the system SHALL display all workspaces they have access to
3. WHEN a user updates workspace details THEN the system SHALL save the changes and maintain data integrity
4. WHEN a user deletes a workspace THEN the system SHALL remove the workspace and all associated data (KPIs, goals, strategies)
5. IF a user is not the workspace owner THEN the system SHALL prevent workspace deletion

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a workspace owner, I want to invite team members to my workspace, so that we can collaborate on tracking KPIs and goals.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a workspace owner sends an invite THEN the system SHALL create a pending invitation with an expiration date and send an email notification
2. WHEN an invited user accepts an invitation THEN the system SHALL grant them access to the workspace with member role
3. WHEN an invited user declines or ignores an invitation THEN the system SHALL keep the invitation in pending status until expiration
4. IF an invitation expires THEN the system SHALL automatically remove the pending invitation
5. WHEN a workspace owner views invitations THEN the system SHALL display all pending invitations for their workspace with status and expiration dates
6. WHEN a workspace owner cancels a pending invitation THEN the system SHALL remove the invitation and prevent access

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user with access to multiple workspaces, I want to easily switch between workspaces, so that I can manage different projects efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user has access to multiple workspaces THEN the system SHALL display a workspace switcher in the navigation
2. WHEN a user selects a different workspace THEN the system SHALL switch context and display that workspace's data
3. WHEN a user switches workspaces THEN the system SHALL maintain their current page context when possible
4. IF a user has only one workspace THEN the system SHALL hide the workspace switcher
5. WHEN a user switches workspaces THEN the system SHALL update the URL to reflect the current workspace

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all workspace data to be properly isolated, so that users can only access data from workspaces they belong to.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user queries KPIs THEN the system SHALL only return KPIs from their accessible workspaces
2. WHEN a user queries goals THEN the system SHALL only return goals from their accessible workspaces
3. WHEN a user queries strategies THEN the system SHALL only return strategies from their accessible workspaces
4. IF a user attempts to access data from an unauthorized workspace THEN the system SHALL deny access and return an error
5. WHEN database queries are executed THEN the system SHALL enforce Row-Level Security policies for workspace isolation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a workspace member, I want to see my role and permissions within each workspace, so that I understand what actions I can perform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views workspace settings THEN the system SHALL display their role (owner, admin, member) and associated permissions
2. WHEN a user attempts an action THEN the system SHALL check their permissions for that workspace before execution
3. IF a user lacks permissions for an action THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message and prevent the action
4. WHEN workspace permissions change THEN the system SHALL update the user's access immediately without requiring re-login
5. WHEN a user is removed from a workspace THEN the system SHALL revoke all access to that workspace's data and redirect them to an accessible workspace

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a workspace owner, I want to manage member roles and permissions, so that I can control who can perform administrative actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a workspace owner views members THEN the system SHALL display all workspace members with their current roles
2. WHEN a workspace owner changes a member's role THEN the system SHALL update their permissions immediately
3. WHEN a workspace owner removes a member THEN the system SHALL revoke their access and notify them via email
4. IF a workspace owner tries to remove themselves THEN the system SHALL prevent the action unless transferring ownership first
5. WHEN a workspace owner transfers ownership THEN the system SHALL update roles and notify both parties
