# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The notifications system enables Sesari to keep users informed about important workspace events, billing status changes, and AI-generated insights. This system supports both email notifications via Resend and real-time in-app notifications through WebSocket connections, with a centralized notification center for managing all user communications.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a workspace owner, I want to receive email notifications about critical billing events, so that I can take action before service interruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a subscription payment fails THEN the system SHALL send an email notification within 1 hour
2. WHEN a trial period expires in 3 days THEN the system SHALL send a reminder email
3. WHEN a subscription is successfully renewed THEN the system SHALL send a confirmation email
4. IF a user has disabled billing notifications THEN the system SHALL NOT send non-critical billing emails

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see in-app notifications for workspace updates, so that I stay informed without checking email constantly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a KPI sync completes THEN the system SHALL display an in-app notification
2. WHEN AI generates new goal suggestions THEN the system SHALL show a notification badge
3. WHEN another workspace member adds a KPI THEN the system SHALL notify other members in real-time
4. IF a user is offline THEN the system SHALL queue notifications for delivery when they return

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want a notification center to manage all my notifications, so that I can review and control my notification preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click the notification bell THEN the system SHALL display all unread notifications
2. WHEN I mark a notification as read THEN the system SHALL update the read status immediately
3. WHEN I access notification settings THEN the system SHALL allow me to toggle email and in-app preferences
4. WHEN I have more than 50 notifications THEN the system SHALL paginate the notification list

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want reliable notification delivery tracking, so that I can monitor system health and user engagement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an email is sent THEN the system SHALL log the delivery status and timestamp
2. WHEN an email fails to send THEN the system SHALL retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff
3. WHEN a WebSocket connection drops THEN the system SHALL attempt to reconnect automatically
4. IF notification delivery fails permanently THEN the system SHALL log the failure for monitoring
