# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the authentication and access control system for Sesari, an AI-powered KPI tracker and strategy planner. The system must provide secure, scalable authentication using Google OAuth and implement workspace-based access control with role-based permissions. The authentication system serves as the foundation for multi-tenant architecture with Row-Level Security (RLS) enforcement across all database operations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a founder, I want to sign in with my Google account, so that I can quickly access the platform without creating separate credentials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the sign-in page THEN the system SHALL display a "Sign in with Google" button
2. WHEN a user clicks the Google sign-in button THEN the system SHALL redirect to Google OAuth consent screen
3. WHEN a user completes Google OAuth flow THEN the system SHALL create or update their user record in the database
4. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to their dashboard
5. IF Google OAuth fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message and allow retry

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want user sessions to include workspace context and role information, so that access control can be enforced throughout the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user authenticates THEN the system SHALL create a JWT token containing userId, workspaceId, role, and plan information
2. WHEN a user accesses any protected route THEN the system SHALL validate the JWT token and extract session context
3. WHEN a JWT token expires THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh the token or redirect to sign-in
4. IF a user belongs to multiple workspaces THEN the system SHALL default to their primary workspace
5. WHEN session data is accessed THEN the system SHALL provide type-safe helper functions for role and workspace validation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want role-based access control, so that different user types can access appropriate features and data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system defines user roles THEN it SHALL support SUPERADMIN, WORKSPACE_ADMIN, EDITOR, and VIEWER roles
2. WHEN a user accesses a protected component THEN the system SHALL render content based on their role permissions
3. WHEN an unauthorized user attempts to access restricted content THEN the system SHALL hide the content or show an access denied message
4. WHEN role permissions change THEN the system SHALL update the user's session without requiring re-authentication
5. IF a user has no assigned role THEN the system SHALL default to VIEWER (most restrictive) permissions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security-conscious founder, I want all database queries to enforce workspace isolation, so that my data remains private and secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any Prisma query executes THEN the system SHALL automatically apply Row-Level Security filters based on workspace context
2. WHEN a user attempts to access data from another workspace THEN the system SHALL block the query and return no results
3. WHEN RLS policies are applied THEN the system SHALL ensure no performance degradation beyond acceptable limits
4. WHEN database operations fail due to RLS violations THEN the system SHALL log security events for monitoring
5. IF RLS enforcement is bypassed THEN the system SHALL require explicit superadmin privileges and audit logging

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want my authentication state to persist across browser sessions, so that I don't need to sign in repeatedly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user signs in successfully THEN the system SHALL create a persistent session that survives browser restarts
2. WHEN a user closes and reopens their browser THEN the system SHALL automatically restore their authenticated state
3. WHEN a session approaches expiration THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh the token in the background
4. WHEN a user explicitly signs out THEN the system SHALL immediately invalidate all session tokens
5. IF a security breach is detected THEN the system SHALL provide mechanisms to invalidate all user sessions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want middleware-based route protection, so that authentication checks are consistently applied across all protected routes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application defines protected routes THEN middleware SHALL automatically verify authentication before allowing access
2. WHEN an unauthenticated user accesses a protected route THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the sign-in page
3. WHEN middleware validates a session THEN it SHALL make user context available to the route handler
4. WHEN route protection is configured THEN it SHALL support both page-level and API route protection
5. IF middleware encounters an error THEN it SHALL fail securely by denying access rather than allowing it

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive test coverage for authentication flows, so that security vulnerabilities can be detected early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication tests run THEN they SHALL cover Google OAuth sign-in flow end-to-end
2. WHEN unit tests execute THEN they SHALL verify JWT token creation, validation, and refresh logic
3. WHEN integration tests run THEN they SHALL validate session callback functions and role-based access
4. WHEN security tests execute THEN they SHALL attempt common attack vectors like token manipulation
5. IF any authentication test fails THEN the system SHALL prevent deployment to production environments
